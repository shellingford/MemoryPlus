Memory+
========

It's a bit modified memory game where you don't have pairs of identical cards, but pairs are connected by some association. For example, one pair is two cards where each card represents a side of an equation, so to get full points you need to know the exact equation. This stimulates not only memory of remembering where each card is, but the memory of association too.
For now, you get 3 points for finding a pair and knowing the association, and 1 point for finding a pair but not knowing the association.

WARNING: don't look at the code too hard, it needs alot of refactoring, it was just a test project to try XNA
